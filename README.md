Project Overview:

- The project focuses on analyzing Raman spectroscopy data to characterize materials by preprocessing and analyzing a synthetic Raman spectrum created from a mix of individual spectra of constituent elements. The contents are written in greek since this project was part of a data science bootcamp offered by the University of Crete.
  
Objective:

- Preprocessing: The aim is to clean the synthetic Raman spectrum to prepare it for analysis.
- Analysis: Estimating the characteristics of the constituent elements in the spectrum.

Data:

- The provided data is a synthetic Raman spectrum stored in a CSV file, constructed from Gaussian peaks representing individual constituent elements, and includes various sources of noise to simulate real-world conditions.

Tools and Resources:

- Python Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy
